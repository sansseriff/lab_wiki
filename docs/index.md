# SNSPD Internet Accessible Wiki 


This is a static site wiki for the INQNET and JPL SNSPD teams. It's intended for storing non-sensitive information related to regular lab operation, especially any info that should be easier to access for INQNET people (who may not know about or remember the JPL SNSPD wiki). 

And crucially, this wiki has a guide on how to restart the JPL SNSPD wiki. 

Unlike a full Wikijs installation, this wiki cannot be edited using a friendly web-based editor. To edit, clone the repository, make additions or edits to the underlying markdown files, and submit a pull request. 

This site is hosted with github pages which should be free and low maintenance. Consider this the 'wiki for the wiki'.
