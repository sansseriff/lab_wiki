# SNSPD Internet Accessible Wiki

For the INQNET & JPL SNSPD teams 

This is a static-site wiki for the INQNET and JPL SNSPD teams. It's intended for storing non-sensitive information related to regular lab operation, especially any info that should be easier to access than the lab-locked SNSPD Wiki. 

Unlike a full Wikijs installation, this wiki cannot be edited using a friendly web-based editor. To edit, clone the repository, make additions or edits to the underlying markdown files, and submit a pull request. 

This site is hosted with github pages which should be free and low maintenance.
